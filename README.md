# FSJS Project 9: REST API
My ninth project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program at Treehouse. An API for administering a school database of users and courses. This project is used to support [Project 10](https://github.com/ramoshe/thp10-fullStackApp) which adds a React frontend to create a complete app.

## How To Use
 - You can view a live version of this project here: https://g.ramoshe.com/thp9-RESTAPI/
 - If you want a local copy of the project:
    1. Download the files: https://github.com/ramoshe/thp9-RESTAPI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
    3. In the console, navigate to the main project folder
    4. Run `npm install` to install all project dependencies
    5. Run `npm run seed` to load the seed data
    6. Run `npm start` to get the project running on port 5000
    7. Load the `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json` file into Postman to test all of the API's routes. If you don't have Postman [you can download it here](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).


## Project Description
*From Treehouse*
 
In this project, you’ll create a REST API using Express. This API will provide a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. To make changes to the database, users will be required to log in so the API will also allow users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.

In a future project, you will use React to create a front-end client that uses this REST API as a part of a full-stack JavaScript application.

To complete this project, you’ll use your knowledge of Node.js, Express, REST APIS, and Sequelize. To test your application, you'll use Postman, a popular application for exploring and testing REST APIs.
